    <h2>What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</h2>
<p>
    A block-leavel element is an element that always takes up the full width available,
    and it also starts a new line that with give it margine before and after.
    An inline element on the other hand does not start a new line of code,
    and it only takes up the space necessary for the code.
