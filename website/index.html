    <h1>This is all about boots and how the 
        toes relate to comfort.</h1>
    <p>We see all the styles of boots and the diffrent toes but is there 
        a reason behind it all. After doing some looking 
        we found some answers. In our Styles page you can see the styles and there meanings.
        Also if you would we have a brief survay in our contact us page as well on your favorite style, along with your name and email.
