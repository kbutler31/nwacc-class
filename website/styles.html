    <h2>Styles and The Meanings</h2>
    <p>We will start with comfort first, the square toes broad or standard are 
        tradionaly used in farming and types of work that are on uneven ground and in mud where you might need
        more stability and comfort.
        Where round toes are typically found in manufactoring for the comfort as well but the rounded
        front often help when you run into things let your foot glance off and be protected.
        Last we have the pointed boots, they come in all kinds of designs as these boots are mainly worn as a dress style boot,
        and are often have very elaborite styles of leather as well, like gator, ostrich, or even rattlesnake.
